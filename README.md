### Overtime App - Ruby on Rails

**A business app used for logging and managing overtime hours.**

---

This is a project mimicking an app for logging and managing overtime. Users (employees) have the ability to log their
overtime completed that week. While admin users have the ability to approve or reject requested overtime.

The main aim of this project was to produce an effective test suite for a Rails App via TDD and BDD, using RSpec, Factories (FactoryBot), Faker, DB cleaner, Model and Request specs.

The actual project premise was taken from this course found on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-ruby-on-rails-coding-course/learn/lecture/5474690#overview)
